### About Myself

I began my IT career in 2016 I was doing it alongside my main job. I am the head of the energy dispatch group at the state enterprise "Vodokanal of St. Petersburg".
I was making layouts of simple websites with WordPress CMS and customizing of ready-made Envato Market templates for the customersâ€™ businesses. 
Then I got interested in using WordPress custom fields to build layouts. At the same time, I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP by taking various courses. 
So I started creating my own websites without using CMS, which were designed by my wife. We work well together. My wife and I even had our own business: creating websites of any complexity with unique designs and promoting them on the Internet.
I received Backend lessons and tips from my brother. He works as a web developer in a large company "Vodopad", which sells sanitary equipment all over Russia.
But I didn't stop there. I wanted something more. I wanted to have more knowledge of JavaScript and usage a large stack of technologies. I believe that it can only be achieved by working in a large company with a team of programmers. So, I started to study JavaScript on a more advanced level. On the advice of a close friend, who works as a React Native developer, I studied the library of React + Redux.
Nowadays, you can learn anything if you really want to. There is a huge number of free high-quality resources for self-education. 

I am very pedantic in my work. I am very thorough and I always pay attention to details. I never do anything carelessly. I want to know all the details and I always strive to get the perfect result. I always finish my work on time. 

I am interested in web development because this profession provides endless opportunities for professional growth and a better future.
